Late Binding and Type Mismatches: VBScript uses late binding by default. This means that type checking happens at runtime, which can lead to unexpected errors if the type of a variable doesn't match what a function expects.  For example, passing a string to a function that expects a number can cause a runtime error that's difficult to track down.  Explicit type checking is rarely performed, so you may not detect such errors until execution.
